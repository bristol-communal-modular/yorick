# Build

The files here are meant to be useful during the building process.

* **ibom.html** is an interactive Bill-of-Materials. Open the file in a web browser and it makes it easy to see which parts go where.
* **parts-placement-guide** is meant to be printed out as part of the workshop kit.
* **yorick-bom.csv** is the full Bill-of-Materials. Mainly useful if you're ordering the parts yourself.
* **yorick-schematic.pdf** is the full schematic for Yorick. This can be helpful when debugging if you aren't able to open the KiCAD projects.

## Other Useful Info

If you're building Yorick yourself outside of a BCM workshop, or a kit you've bought, then you may find it easier to use this Mouser link to order some of the parts.

This doesn't include the Potentiometers, the jacks, or any control knobs though.

Yorick is designed to use the [Thonkiconn](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/thonkiconn/) jacks, and the [Alpha 9mm](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/alpha-9mm-pots-vertical-t18/) potentiometers available from Thonk. Depending on where you are it may be easier to find these elsewhere though.

It's worth noting that if you use D-shaft potentiometers then standard D-shaft knobs with indicators will have an odd orientation because the pots on the PCB are upside down. We recommend using T18 or Round shaft potentiometers, or getting reversed D-shaft knobs, [like these ones from Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/black-d-shaft-reverse/).
