# Hardware

This folder contains the files for the Yorick hardware. Currently this is :-

* The KiCAD project for the most up to date Yorick version.
* The gerber files for the most up to date Yorick PCB.
* The KiCad project for the very first prototype. Mainly left for interest and not recommended for building.
* A DXF file that can be used to create a backplate to mount onto Yorick (Currently out of date with latest revision).
